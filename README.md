<h1>An exhibitions app</h1>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>This web and mobile app looks to improve on the current offering of applications that provide information on current exhibitions in London.</p>
<h2>How does it work</h2>
<h3>How is data gathered</h3>
<p>Web-scraping! Using a combination of ML and NLP techniques, info on exhibitions is lifted from the websites of galleries and stored in the DB.</p>
<h3>How is data presented to the user</h3>
<p>Both on mobile and web, the idea is to primarily display exhibitions on a map. This encourages users to view art that is local, rather than that belonging to a big name gallery. 
Once pins on the map are clicked, details on name, location, price, pictures etc... are displayed to the user</p>
